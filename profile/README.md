## About the Project

Mental health issues among Gen Z in Indonesia have been on the rise, with limited access to services tailored to their needs. Our team identified this gap and developed an innovative solution combining **machine learning**, **mobile development**, and **cloud computing** to empower users in managing their mental health. By leveraging technology, we aim to help users independently understand their mood patterns and improve their overall well-being.
